		  <h1> About us: </h1> 
		  <p> <h3> Layla was born in Glasnevin on a warm summers day in June 2006. She was one of 12 puppies born, and she was by far the cheekiest.At six weeks old we took layla to her new home. She tore our garden to shreds, ate the furniture and got herself stuck under the garden shed. But at the end of the day, those serbian good looks always won us over, and we immeditately forgave the little snow ball. Layla is now 14 years old and like most pensioners, spends her day napping,giving out, and acting grumpy. </h3> </p> 
<p> <h3> Originally from serbia Layla can speak fluent russian,ukranian and serbian. English seems to be a challenge for her and when given a comand by us her family, she generally doesn't follow it... </h3> </p>  
<p> <h3> If you think you recognise Layla well then yes, you would be correct. Layla has become an instagram sensation as of late. She uses her platform to highlight older instagram dogs, and give them a voice.</h3></p>

		   <h1> Samoyed History</h1> 
		   <p> <h3> Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night. A working breed, the Samoyed can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs.</h3> </p>
